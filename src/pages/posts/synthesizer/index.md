title: "Web synthesizer with WebGL visualisation"

<strong>This project is not finished yet, but you can already play around with it.</strong><br>
This is a spare-time project of mine, where I explored the possibilities of visualising synthesizer parameters with WebGL.
The synth itself is build using React and Redux. I used CSS Grid and D3 to realise a complex layout that resembles a real life synthesizer.
